- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence tracks the relationship between two moving averages of a price. A MACD crossing above its signal line suggests bullish momentum, whereas crossing below indicates bearish momentum.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: A momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to its price range over a specific period. It consists of two lines: %K (fast) and %D (slow). Readings above 80 indicate overbought conditions, while those below 20 suggest oversold conditions.
- **Bollinger Bands**: A set of three lines: the middle is a 20-day average price, and the two outer lines adjust based on price volatility. The outer bands widen with more volatility and narrow when less. They help identify when prices might be too high (touching the upper band) or too low (touching the lower band), suggesting potential market moves.

## Examples
### Example Instruction for Making a Decision (JSON format)
#### Example: Recommendation to Buy
```json
{
    "decision": "buy",
    "percentage": 20,
    "reason": "After reviewing the current investment state and incorporating insights from both market analysis and recent stock news, a bullish trend is evident. The EMA_10 has crossed above the SMA_10, a signal often associated with the initiation of an uptrend. This crossover, combined with our analysis of the current market sentiment being positively influenced by recent news articles, suggests increasing momentum and a strong opportunity for a profitable buy decision. This decision aligns with our risk management protocols, considering both the potential for profit and the current balance of the portfolio."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "buy",
    "percentage": 25,
    "reason": "The analysis of both daily and hourly OHLCV data has revealed a noteworthy pattern: the occurrence of falling tails three times, indicating strong buying pressure and price rejection at lower levels. This pattern suggests a foundation for market reversal and potential uptrend initiation. Supported by the technical analysis, where the EMA_10 has crossed above the SMA_10, a bullish trend appears imminent. This technical signal, in conjunction with the identified pattern and positive market sentiment influenced by recent favorable crypto news, signifies increasing momentum and presents a compelling opportunity for a profitable buy decision. Aligning this decision with our risk management protocols, the consideration of the market's current state and portfolio balance suggests that allocating 25% of the portfolio to this buying opportunity optimizes the potential for profit while managing exposure to market volatility. This strategic decision leverages both technical patterns and market sentiment analysis, positioning the portfolio to capitalize on the anticipated upward market movement."
}
```

#### Example: Recommendation to Sell
```json
{
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 40,
    "reason": "Upon detailed analysis of the asset's historical data and previous decision outcomes, it is evident that the asset is currently peaking near a historically significant resistance level. This observation is underscored by the RSI_15 indicator's ascent into overbought territory above 75, hinting at an overvaluation of the asset. Such overbought conditions are supported by a noticeable bearish divergence in the MACD, where despite the asset's price holding near its peak, the MACD line demonstrates a downward trajectory. This divergence aligns with a marked increase in trading volume, indicative of a potential buying climax which historically precedes market corrections. Reflecting on past predictions, similar conditions have often resulted in favorable sell outcomes, reinforcing the current decision to sell. Considering these factors - historical resistance alignment, overbought RSI_15, MACD bearish divergence, and peak trading volume - alongside a review of previous successful sell signals under comparable conditions, a strategic decision to sell 40% of the asset is recommended to leverage the anticipated market downturn and secure profits from the elevated price levels."
}
```

#### Example: Recommendation to Hold
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The current analysis of market data and news indicates a complex trading environment. The MACD remains above its Signal line, suggesting potential buy signals, but the MACD Histogram's volume shows diminishing momentum. Recent news is mixed, introducing ambiguity into market sentiment. Given these factors and in alignment with our risk management principles, the decision to hold reflects a strategic choice to preserve capital amidst market uncertainty, allowing us to remain positioned for future opportunities while awaiting more definitive market signals."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "the market analysis indicates a notable imbalance in the order book, with a significantly higher total ask size compared to the total bid size, suggesting a potential decrease in buying interest which could lead to downward price pressure. Lastly, given the portfolio's current state, with no stock holdings and a posture of observing market trends, it is prudent to continue holding and wait for more definitive market signals before executing new trades. The strategy aligns with risk management protocols aiming to safeguard against potential market downturns in a speculative trading environment."
